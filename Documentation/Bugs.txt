BUG LIST

1. When trying to exit using ‘x’ will just reload the screen, will eventually exit on enough clicks but will not do it right away
2. Gameover with a power up may cause you to start next game with the power ups effect for a second
3. Show High-Score will crash the game
4. No matter how the game is exited, the Python shell will return errors (no significant effect on operation of program).
5. Menu’s icon cursor freezes sometimes
6. Collision handling for flea mode (yellow upgrade) is off, probably is impossible to continue without losing with it
7. Bird glitches behind pipe for a split second when it collides with it
